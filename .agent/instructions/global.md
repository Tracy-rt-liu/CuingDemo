# Global Rules and Principles

This file contains the core principles and rules that I, the AI assistant, should follow for this project.

## Core Mandates
1. **Consistency**: Ensure all code follow the established patterns in the project (e.g., Streamlit patterns in `app.py`).
2. **Safety**: Never execute destructive commands without explicit confirmation.
3. **Clarity**: Provide clear, concise explanations for all changes.
4. **Verification**: Always verify changes by checking the terminal output or browser state.
5. **Editing**: Only execute relevant commands to the most recent query. Do not execute other tasks that are unrelated to the current query.

## Operational Rules
- Check this folder for any specific instructions before starting a new task.
- Document significant architectural decisions in the brain artifacts.
